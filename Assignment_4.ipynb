    "The only events that are independent of themselves are those with probability either 0 or 1. That follows from the fact that a number is its own square if and only if it's either 0 or 1. The only way a random variable X can be independent of itself is if for every measurable set A, either Pr(X∈A)=1 or Pr(X∈A)=0."
